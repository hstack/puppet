		<description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
		For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
		By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
		of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
		list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
		this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.
